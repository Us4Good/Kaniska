Approach 1:

Summary: Use pre-trained tensorflow model

Repo: https://github.com/kaniska/skylab-wildfiredetection

Code: https://github.com/kaniska/skylab-wildfiredetection/blob/master/smoke-detection-camera/object_detection_wildfire.ipynb

Docs: https://github.com/kaniska/skylab-wildfiredetection/blob/master/README.md

Status:
  ToDo: Run Inference code in High-performance GPU Cluster using Google Colab and calculate score for given test images 



Approach 2:

Summary: Train the model using given labelled input data

Code: https://colab.research.google.com/github/aiformankind/lets-stop-wildfires-hackathon/blob/master/Challenge_1B_WildfireSmokeImageClassifierForDemo.ipynb

Status:
  ToDo: 
  (1) Figure out how to feed sample test images to the running model
  (2) Further tune given model
  (3) Run in High-performance GPU Cluster using Google Colab and calculate score for given test images
